## Description
It is a **2D danmaku game** where the player controls a character dodging patterns of projectiles while shooting enemies. It connects to media and digital technology through interactive design and real-time animation.

## Features
 **Player Moving and Shooting**  
The player can move smoothly in all directions using wasd to control and shoot bullets toward enemies. This will be executed using real-time input detection and continuous projectile spawning

 **Enemy Attack Patterns**  
Enemies will fire patterned projectiles that the player must dodge. These patterns will be created through looping functions that control bullet angles and speed

 **Scoring and Health System**  
The player earns points for hitting enemies and loses health when hit by bullets. Variables will track score and health, updating the display during gameplay.

## Challenges
- Learning to detect player input
- Learning how to manage multiple moving objects on screen at once
- Designing bullet patterns for fair yet challenging gameplay

## Outcomes
**Ideal Outcome:**
A simple but visually appealing bullet hell game with smooth controls, one boss with different attack patterns, and background music or sound effects

**Minimal Viable Outcome:**
A functional game with player movement, shooting, at least one enemy with bullet patterns, and basic win/lose conditions
