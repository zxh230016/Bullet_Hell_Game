## Description
It is a **bullet hell game demo** inspired by Touhou Project where the player controls a character dodging bullets while shooting enemy. I tried to create the retro vibe with pixel-style fonts and 8-bit background music.  

In the full game, I want to make some pixel art for the player and enemies with simple animations of moving and attacking. I’m also planning to add more dannmaku patterns so the game has a wider mix of attacks and stays interesting to play.  

All the png files are images of the bullets that I drew.  

You can launch the game by main.py.
